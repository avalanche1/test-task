This little app can parse Russian passports using Google cloud vision OCR.

Intentional limitations: Accepts only images; parses data only if positioned correctly.

Your task:
  - Make this app work with pdf files
  - Remove positioning limitation
  - It is welcome if you can build a simple ui to output the results using 'antd' lib
  - Commit to master as you would on a production project (remember that incremental commits are favoured to huge commits)
  - You can use whatever means you deem necessary; get creative!

Code quality:
  - Make sure your code is either self-documenting or has extensive documentation
  - Try to have as little eslint and typescript warnings as possible
  - Do not use suprressing directives like //ts-ignore
  - Do not modify .eslintrc & .tsconfig.json
